# Fame through surprise: How fame-seeking mass shooters diversify their attacks.

This repository has the code used to produce the results the paper entitiled: "Fame through surprise: How fame-seeking mass shooters diversify their attacks."

The repository contains four files:

1-Statistics: a noteboook that was compiled with the original dataset to show the results of the manuscript. The notebook is static and should not be compiled again as it would not produce correct results (Wihout the original dataset).

2-Dummy_Statistics: a notebook that can be executed with the "Mass_Shootings_dummy" dummy dataset to give a sense on how the code is built.

3-Mass_Shootings_dummy: a dummy dataset of mock mass shootings. The original dataset will be available upon request from the correspinding author: mporfiri@nyu.edu.

4-Monte_Carlo:a noteboook that was compiled with the original dataset to show the results of the robustness test with respect to Target Group feature. The notebook is static and should not be compiled again as it would not produce correct results (Wihout the original dataset).

5-Dummy_Monte_Carlo:a notebook that can be executed with the "Mass_Shootings_dummy" dummy dataset to give a sense on how the code for the robustness is built.

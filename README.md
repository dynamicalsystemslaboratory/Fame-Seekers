# Fame through surprise: How fame-seeking mass shooters diversify their attacks.

Note: On the vertical axis of Fig. 1, the 10^4 mark was inadvertently skipped. Markers on the axis should start from 10^1 and end at 10^6.


This repository has the code used to produce the results of the paper entitled: "Fame through surprise: How fame-seeking mass shooters diversify their attacks."

The repository contains four files:

1-Statistics: a notebook that was compiled with the original dataset to show the results of the manuscript. The notebook is static and should not be compiled again as it would not produce correct results (Wihout the original dataset).

2-Dummy_Statistics: a notebook that can be executed with the "Mass_Shootings_dummy" dummy dataset to give a sense of how the code is built.

3-Mass_Shootings_dummy: a dummy dataset of mock mass shootings. The original dataset will be available upon request from the corresponding author: mporfiri@nyu.edu.

4-Monte_Carlo: a notebook that was compiled with the original dataset to show the results of the robustness test with respect to Target Group feature. The notebook is static and should not be compiled again as it would not produce correct results (Without the original dataset).

5-Dummy_Monte_Carlo: a notebook that can be executed with the "Mass_Shootings_dummy" dummy dataset to give a sense of how the code for robustness is built.

6-Surprisal and Fame Values: contains the values of surprisal and fame measures presented in the supplementary information of the paper.
